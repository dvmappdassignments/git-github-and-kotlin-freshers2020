You are first supposed to learn about **git**, **Github** and **Kotlin**. You may refer the above resources, or any other resources you like.  
You will also have to learn the **basic syntax of kotlin.**  
After learning about git ,github and kotlin, you are expected to **create a new branch** in the repository **with your name**, **create a new folder** within the branch with your name, copy RestrauntBillingSystem.kt in that folder, **complete the implementation of RestrauntBillingSystem.kt in kotlin**, commit your changes on your branch, and push them with **appropriate commit messages.**  
After completing the tasks, you would have to **create a pull request** to merge your branch with the master branch.  
Before we accept the pull requests on 5th September, we expect you all to **review each other's code**, and have a constructive discussion on the pull requests.  
While writing the code, you are expected to **follow proper indentation, java naming conventions, and comment your code.**
